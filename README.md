# RussianRoulette

This is a simple app based on the russian roulette's rules.

basically you can just add as many bullets as you want and click the roll button.

However there is also a score system. Depending on how many bullets you add, you gain points if you survive :
1 bullet -> 1 point  
2 bullets -> 3 points  
3 bullets -> 5 points  
4 bullets -> 10 points  
5 bullets -> 15 points  
6 bullets -> you should think twice  

When you stop on a bullet the score is reset to 0.
